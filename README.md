Do you remember Fuzznuc?
Well, one of my collegue would like
to use it, but we never found the good
old web interface to this program.

She use Windows, so the command line version
was not an option. I have decided to write
a program with similar functionality.

The program can handle FASTA format only. You can use
more than one FASTA records.

The results can be exported as CSV files (tab separated).

Do not need to install, just run. I have tested on Windows 7, 8.1, 10

You need only .Net 4.5.1 to run it.

Visual Studio 2015 project file included.
